The Colosseum of Rome
a model created by Michael "Vergilius" Brown
Construction began around 70 A.D. under the reign of Emperor Vespasian, who marked the beginnings of the Flavian Dynasty
The site was built directly upon the lake of Domus Aurea, Nero's Golden House
The lake was drained by the orders of Vespasian, for it was vengeance for the many people of Rome who had suffered from Nero's outrageous and tyrannical behavior as an emperor
The Flavian Amphitheatre was completed around 80 A.D. under the reign of Vespasian's successor and heir, Emperor Titus
It consisted of steadily made bricks of travertine and sand
Eighty arches outside each of the first three levels
The Classical Orders of Architecture
Seating made for over thousands of people
An underground that would both confine and release mysterious entities ranging from hopeless slaves to murderous beasts
Of course, even though the model doesn't have an underground, if there was one, it would definitely be right here
The Flavian Amphitheatre then had its grand opening, and the Romans were entertained with one hundred days of games and over five thousand animal slaughterings
Soon, the Amphitheatre became a grand site of common entertainment for the public audience
Immersed with games consisting of various daily gladiatorial battles
Execution
Mock naval combat and more
During the Middle Ages, Colossus of Nero, originally built for the Golden House, was seen along with Flavian Amphitheatre, both connected to eachother due to their great heights
Thus, they finally named Amphitheatre with its well known name we know today as the "Colosseum"
At the end, as society shifted away from the expense and the chosen entertainment of the Colosseum during the Middle Ages, the Amphitheatre would endure earthquakes and neglect but still stand as a famous milestone of Italy
